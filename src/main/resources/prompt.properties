prompt.text=Analyze this GitHub profile: %s. \
  Create a professional Russian-language resume for a software developer based on the candidate?s GitHub repositories, activity, and projects.\
  Use the structure and tone recommended by Yandex Practicum?s Resume Builder (https://practicum.yandex.ru/profile/resume/), integrating key lessons: \
  Lesson 2 ? ?Main information? (structure and layout for contacts, photos, positions, and cities); \
  Lesson 5 ? ?If you have no experience? (how to describe study and pet projects); \
  Lesson 7 ? ?Skills? (focus on hard skills and relevant keywords); \
  Lesson 8 ? ?About me? (motivation, interest in the profession, uniqueness, natural tone). \
  Requirements for the final text: The resume must be entirely in Russian, with English terms only when technically necessary. The tone should be confident, professional, but natural and human. The text must be readable and optimized for recruiters and ATS systems (HeadHunter, hh.ru). Avoid clichés and bureaucratic phrasing. \
  Structure of the final resume: \
  1. Main Information ? name, desired position (in standard recruiter format, e.g. ?Backend Developer? or ?Junior Python Developer?), city of residence, relocation/remote readiness, contacts (phone, email, Telegram, GitHub), and mention of a photo (but do not include it). Do not mention expected salary. \
  2. About Me ? 3?5 sentences describing motivation, interest in software development, key strengths, learning experience, and personal goals. Highlight awareness of the profession, participation in projects, and continuous growth. For beginners ? focus on motivation and fast learning; for experienced candidates ? on achievements and advantages. End with a short personal fact (e.g. hackathons or open-source contributions). \
  3. Skills ? list only hard skills relevant to development. Divide into categories: Programming languages, Frameworks and libraries, Tools and services, Databases and DevOps, Methodologies and principles. Limit to 5-12 concise items. \
  4. Work Experience / Projects ? if no commercial experience, mark items as ?(training project)? or ?(pet project)?. Choose 1-3 significant GitHub projects and describe each briefly: what the project does, what exactly the candidate developed, main technologies, and GitHub link. Use active verbs like ?developed?, ?implemented?, ?created?, ?optimized?. \
  5. Education ? include university/college (with years), plus online courses or additional education (Yandex Practicum, Stepik, Coursera, etc.). If no formal education, focus on practical skills and self-study. \
  6. Contacts ? include professional email, phone, Telegram, GitHub, and portfolio link. \
  Additional rules: \
  Avoid repetition and salary expectations. \
  Keep the structure clean and natural, without markdown formatting. \
  The resume should sound as if written by the candidate themselves. \
  Output only the final Russian-language resume text, without explanations, notes, or English commentary. \
  The text must be ready for posting on hh.ru or cv.hh.
